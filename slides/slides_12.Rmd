# Mapping attributes to aesthetics 

Q: What is the **unit of observation**? 

A: A country in a year

Q: How are a country-year's **attributes** mapped to **aesthetic** components of the graphic?

```{r, echo = F}
tribble(~Attribute, ~Aesthetic,
        "Income", "Horizontal position (x)",
        "Life expectancy", "Vertical position (y)",
        "Population", "Size of point",
        "Continent", "Color of point"
        ) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl()
```

# Mapping attributes to aesthetics 

Q: What is the **unit of observation**? 

A: An army (army division) on a day ("army-day")

Q: How are an army-day's **attributes** mapped to **aesthetic** components of the graphic?

```{r, echo = F}
tribble(~Attribute, ~Aesthetic,
        "Longitude", "Horizontal position (x)",
        "Latitude", "Vertical position (y)",
        "Number of surviving soldiers", "Width of line",
        "Direction (advance, retreat)", "Color of line"
        ) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl()
```

(Also note secondary plot showing temperature during retreat.)

# Data: structure

Our data is typically **rectangular**, with rows and columns like a spreadsheet.

--

Usually, 

- each row should be one observation (e.g. country-year, army-day)
- each column should contain one attribute (e.g. life expectancy, number of surviving troops)

--

For example: 

```{r, echo = F}
gapminder::gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  select(-year) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl()

```

???

Data in this format is sometimes referred to as "tidy" [(Wickham 2014)](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). I think this concept is useful as long as you recognize that the definition of "unit of observation" (and thus attribute/variable) depends on the purpose for which the data is being used.

# Making (beautiful and informative) graphics

---

# Making graphics in `R` 

We will use the `ggplot2` library, which is part of the `tidyverse` library.

Basic components of plotting with `ggplot`: 

- data 
- mapping of attributes (columns of data) to aesthetics
- geometric representations of data (`geom`s)

# Quick detour: getting data into `R`

---

# Getting data into `R` (and `RStudio`)

An interactive option: `Import Dataset` button in `Environment` pane of `RStudio`

--

But note it's showing you the code it's using! 

(Live coding example.)

---

# Getting data into `R` (cont'd)

Most commonly used functions: 

- `read_csv()` and `read_rds()` in `readr` (`tidyverse`)
- `readstata13::read.dta13()` for Stata files (`.dta`)
- `readxl::read_excel()` for Excel files (`.xls`, `.xlsx`)
- `load()` in base R for "R objects"

All require "path" to file as argument. 

--

Sometimes data is a package, e.g. `babynames`, `gapminder`, `vdemdata` 

--

See Chapter 11 of R4DS and "Data Import" cheatsheet.


---

## A simple example

Get data in: 

```{r}
gapminder_2007 <- gapminder::gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007)   # will explain next week
```

Make a plot:

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```


---

```{r, fig.height=3.5, fig.width=5, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) + 
  geom_point()
```

To note:

- the **arguments** to `ggplot()` say what the data is (`data = gapminder_2007`) and how attributes are mapped to aesthetics (`mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)`)
- `geom_point()` says "plot a point for each observation"
- **layers** of plat linked with plus sign (`+`)


---

<!-- Let's map population to the size of the points:  -->

```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=5.5, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
                     size = pop)) +  #<<
  geom_point()
```

---

<!-- Let's map continent to the color of the points:  -->

```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=5.5, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
                     size = pop,
                     col = continent)) +  #<<
  geom_point()
```

---

<!-- Let's put the x-axis on the log scale:  -->

```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=5.5, fig.align="center"}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
                     size = pop,
                     col = continent)) +  
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_log10() #<<
```


---

# Minard data 

```{r, echo = F}
minard <- read.table("assets/troops.txt", header = T)
```

```{r, echo = F}
minard %>% 
  slice(1:18) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl()
```

---

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot(data = minard,
       mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, 
                     size = survivors, col = direction,
                     group = group)) + 
  geom_path()
  
```


???

"`geom_path()` connects the observations in the order in which they appear in the data. `geom_line()` connects them in order of the variable on the x axis. `geom_step()` creates a stairstep plot, highlighting exactly when changes occur."

# Back to `gapminder`

```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=5.5, fig.align="center", warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp,
                     size = pop, col = continent)) +  
  geom_point() +   
  scale_x_log10() 
```

# Inheritance of aesthetics 

```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=5.5, fig.align="center", warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +  
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent)) +   #<< 
  scale_x_log10() 
```

# Data summary w. `geom_smooth()` 


```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=5.5, fig.align="center", warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +  
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent)) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth() #<<

# Linear version w. `geom_smooth()` 


```{r, fig.height=4.5, fig.width=5.5, fig.align="center", warning = F, message = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +  
  geom_point(aes(size = pop, col = continent)) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) # lm means "linear model" #<<  
```


???

Anything after # (on the same line) is a "comment" and is ignored by R. This is useful for explaining to humans what is going on in the code.

# Small multiples w. `facet_wrap()` 

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=8.5, fig.align="center", warning = F,  message = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +  
  geom_point(aes(size = pop)) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  facet_wrap(vars(continent)) #<<
```

# Other geoms 

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=8.5, fig.align="center", warning = F,  message = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +  
  geom_density2d() +  #<<
  scale_x_log10()

```

# Other geoms 

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=8.5, fig.align="center", warning = F,  message = F}
ggplot(data = gapminder_2007, 
       mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +  
  geom_label(aes(label = country)) +  #<<
  scale_x_log10()

# Back to the big picture 

Components of a `ggplot`: 

- data, with observations in rows, attributes in columns
- mapping of attributes to aesthetics (x, y, size, shape, color, transparency, etc)
- geometric objects (`geom`s)

Next: getting data into the right format for plotting (and analysis).

# Assignment

Before next lecture, RStudio Cloud primers: 

- "Work with data" (https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2): `tibble`, `select()`, `filter()`, `arrange()`, `%>%`, `summarize()`, `group_by()`, `mutate()`
- "Data vizualization" (https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3): more practice with `ggplot`

Alternatively, Chapters 5&6 of R4DS. 



<!-- ## Plan  -->

<!-- First, examples where data columns already map to desired aesthetics 1 to 1. -->

<!-- - use (`gapminder`?) example to connect data to aesthetics (a la Heiss) -->
<!-- - introduce types of plots (from the cheatsheet?) -->
<!-- - `facet_wrap()`, `facet_grid()` -->
<!-- - practice and use examples -->

<!-- Then, cases where this is not true, and we need to do some data wrangling. -->

<!-- - making a new variable (`mutate()`) -->
<!-- - subsetting (`filter()`) -->
<!-- - summarizing? `group_by()`, `summarize()` -->
<!-- - `pivot_longer()`, `pivot_wider()` -->

<!-- but always ending with a figure I guess. -->

<!-- And that's basically it.  -->
