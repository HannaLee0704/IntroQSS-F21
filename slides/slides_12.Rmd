# Workflow 

1. **Data collection**: run survey, enter data from archive, etc
1. **Data processing**: merge, recode, reshape, aggregate, etc
1. **Data analysis**: visualization, model fitting, hypothesis testing, etc 

???

Typical stats sequences basically deal with model fitting and hyp testing only. But you spend ~ 90% of time on 1 and 2, and visualization is very important. So we're redressing this somewhat.

# Our plan (overview)

- "Data science" first (weeks 1-2, every lab and homework)
  - visualization on "tidied" data
  - learn to "tidy" our data
- Probability/stats essentials (week 3)
- Research design essentials: causality and experiments (week 4)
- Regression (weeks 5 & 6) 
- Inference (weeks 7 & 8)

Cumulative -- please keep up.

Foregrounding "data science" skills, causality.

# Structure of "tidy" data

Observations in rows, each attribute has its own column

Main task then is to tell `R` which columns should represent which attributes.

# Getting data into `R` (and `RStudio`)

An interaction option: `Import Dataset` button in `Environment` pane of `RStudio`

But note it's showing you the code it's using! 

(Live coding example.)

<!-- ## Plan  -->

<!-- First, examples where data columns already map to desired aesthetics 1 to 1. -->

<!-- - use (`gapminder`?) example to connect data to aesthetics (a la Heiss) -->
<!-- - introduce types of plots (from the cheatsheet?) -->
<!-- - `facet_wrap()`, `facet_grid()` -->
<!-- - practice and use examples -->

<!-- Then, cases where this is not true, and we need to do some data wrangling. -->

<!-- - making a new variable (`mutate()`) -->
<!-- - subsetting (`filter()`) -->
<!-- - summarizing? `group_by()`, `summarize()` -->
<!-- - `pivot_longer()`, `pivot_wider()` -->

<!-- but always ending with a figure I guess. -->

<!-- And that's basically it.  -->
