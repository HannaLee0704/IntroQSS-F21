# Workflow 

1. **Data collection**: run survey, enter data from archive, etc
1. **Data processing**: merge, recode, reshape, aggregate, etc
1. **Data analysis**: visualization, model fitting, hypothesis testing, etc 

???

Typical stats sequences basically deal with model fitting and hyp testing only. But you spend ~ 90% of time on 1 and 2, and visualization is very important. So we're redressing this somewhat.

# Our plan (overview)

- "Data science" first (weeks 1-2, every lab and homework)
  - visualization on "tidied" data
  - learn to "tidy" our data
- Probability/stats essentials (week 3)
- Research design essentials: causality and experiments (week 4)
- Regression (weeks 5 & 6) 
- Inference (weeks 7 & 8)

Cumulative -- please keep up.

???

Foregrounding "data science" skills, causality.

# Programming in `R` 

Which one is you? 

1 Never done any programming
1 Did some programming in another language (e.g. Python, Stata)
1 Some experience programming in `R`
1 Experienced at programming in `R`

--

All welcome, but plan your work accordingly.

# Useful resources 

- RStudio Cloud primers (online, interactive) 
- "R For Data Science" book (online or print)  
- Google
- StackOverflow: our private one and "real" one
- Lectures and labs

# Assignment for Thursday

Attempt primers 1.1 and 1.2 on RStudio Cloud: 

- "Data visualization basics" (https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.1)
- "Programming basics" (https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2)

--

To note: 

- For beginners: these are not really sequential, so do 1.2 even if you are lost in 1.1
- For non-beginners: if these are too basic, work on "Read For Data Science" (including exercises)
- For experienced R programmers: if you already know R4DS, let's talk
